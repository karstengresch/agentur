A social news agency. Think Facebook for facts.

## General Concept
Facts (see below) are created by at most three people at a time.

### Rationale
In the previous times (late 1990ies and ongoing) we noticed a tendency in the media to mix fact based information with opinions, marketing collateral or general assumptions.

Our ideal, grounded in Western European and North American democratic values, is that the basic task of media as democratic institution is to inform citizens on facts and make the differentiation from any form of assertions absolutely clear. 

This allows citizens to develop their own political opinions based on the available facts.

Unfortunately, this ideal is undergoing a radical change towards what we call opinionated information: Facts get "enriched" with attributes that should direct the fact receivers in their thinking.

In our opinion, this is the wrong way to do it.

### Fact And Enrichment

#### Fact
A fact is *actual* information that can be proven. 
It differs from e.g. commentary, opinion statement or assertion.

It answers the questions:

  1. What?
  1. When?
  1. Where?
  1. Who? 

*Actual* means that the "When?" question for the initial fact version should point to a backward timeframe of around 24 hours within the timezone of the fact creator(s).
