A social news agency. Think Facebook for facts.

## General Concept

### Rationale


### Fact And Enrichment

#### Fact
A fact is *actual* information that can be proven. 
It differs from e.g. commentary, opinion statement or assertion.

It answers the questions:

  1. What?
  1. When?
  1. Where?
  1. Who? 

*Actual* means that the "When?" question for the initial fact version should point to a backward timeframe of around 24 hours within the timezone of the fact creator(s).
